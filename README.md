Weightlesscord is autoupdating and follows the canary branch by default. if you would rather have a more stable experiance, check out the Weightlesscord LTS branch, and its subset of releases

# Known Issues
* Screen Sharing does not work (Limitation of discord webapp)
* Video Calling can fail (Isolated case on my end, but works for everyone else)
